What is a release date check and why does it fail? A release date check is a security measure that verifies if the game has been officially released in the player's region. It is supposed to prevent piracy and unauthorized distribution of the game. However, sometimes the check can fail due to various reasons, such as:
 
- A faulty or outdated installation of the game
- A corrupted or missing file in the game folder
- An incompatible or outdated version of Origin, the online platform that runs the game
- A firewall or antivirus software that blocks the connection to the EA servers
- A wrong system date or time on the player's computer

How to fix a release date check failure? There are several possible solutions to this problem, depending on the cause. Here are some of them:

1. Run a repair of the game files through Origin. To do this, right-click on the game panel in Origin and select Repair Game. This will scan and fix any corrupted or missing files in the game folder.
2. Update Origin to the latest version. To do this, open Origin and go to Application Settings > General > Update to the latest version of Origin.
3. Disable any firewall or antivirus software that may interfere with the connection to the EA servers. Alternatively, add Origin and Fifa 12 as exceptions to your firewall or antivirus settings.
4. Check and correct your system date and time. To do this, right-click on the clock icon on your taskbar and select Adjust date/time. Make sure your time zone, date, and time are correct.
5. Contact EA customer support for further assistance. To do this, go to https://help.ea.com/en/contact-us/ and select Fifa 12 as your product. You can chat with an advisor or request a callback.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help you fix your Fifa 12 release date check failure and enjoy the game. If not, you may want to try other methods such as reinstalling the game, using a different account, or searching for online forums for more tips.
  
What is Fifa 12 Crackl and why do some players use it? Fifa 12 Crackl is an unofficial modification of the game that bypasses the release date check and allows players to play the game without Origin. It is usually downloaded from illegal websites or torrent sites. Some players may use it to play the game before its official release, to avoid paying for the game, or to avoid any technical issues with Origin.
 
However, using Fifa 12 Crackl is not recommended for several reasons. First of all, it is illegal and violates the terms of service of EA and Origin. Players who use it may face legal consequences or have their accounts banned. Second, it may contain viruses or malware that can harm the player's computer or steal their personal information. Third, it may not work properly or cause glitches and errors in the game. Fourth, it may prevent the player from accessing online features such as multiplayer modes, leaderboards, or updates.
 
Therefore, it is better to avoid using Fifa 12 Crackl and stick to the official version of the game. If you have any problems with the release date check or Origin, you can try the solutions mentioned above or contact EA customer support for help. By doing so, you can enjoy Fifa 12 safely and legally.
